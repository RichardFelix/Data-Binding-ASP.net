# Data-Binding-ASP.net
Data Binding project using ASP.net

This was a project to display a database and perform transanctions on the data.  Also to reject transanctions if needed.  The data binding was to the combo box which had a correlation to the lables below it.  Also to the table with same data that would update when transactions where applied.
